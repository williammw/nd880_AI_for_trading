## Omission: shuffling data
Make sure to shuffle your data, so that your model doesn't learn anything about the ordering of the data, and instead can focus on the content. We can do this with a DataLoader by setting shuffle=True. You'll find this updated code in the exercise and solution notebooks.
```python
# make sure to SHUFFLE your data
train_loader = DataLoader(train_data, shuffle=True, batch_size=batch_size)
valid_loader = DataLoader(valid_data, shuffle=True, batch_size=batch_size)
test_loader = DataLoader(test_data, shuffle=True, batch_size=batch_size)
```
## TensorDataset
Take a look at the source code for the TensorDataset class, you can see that it's "purpose" is to provide an easy way to create a dataset out of standard data structures.
