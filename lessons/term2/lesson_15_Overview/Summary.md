## Summary
* supervised learning: learns from labeled data, maps inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs

* regression: labels are values

* classification: labels are classes

**unsupervised learning**: seeks to cluster or organize unlabeled data
**reinforcement learning**: agents take actions in an environment to maximize reward

## Getting Started
Great! Now that we've learned what supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, classification and regression are, we can get started learning about one type of supervised learning technique that will be crucial for the next project, decision trees. Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression. Let's learn more in the next lesson!
