## Code Walkthrough & Repository
The below video is a walkthrough of code that you can find in our public Github repository, if you navigate to ```recurrent-neural-networks > time-series``` and the [Simple_RNN.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/recurrent-neural-networks/time-series/Simple_RNN.ipynb). Feel free to go through this code on your own, locally.

This example is meant to give you an idea of how PyTorch represents RNNs and how you might represent memory in code. Later, you'll be given more complex exercise and solution notebooks, in-classroom.
