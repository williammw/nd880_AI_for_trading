## Implementing Recurrent Neural Networks
Now that you've learned about RNNs and LSTMs from Luis, it's time to see how we implement them in PyTorch. With a bit of an assist from Mat, I'll be leading you through a couple notebooks showing how to build RNNs with PyTorch. First, I'll show you how to learn from time-series data. Then, you'll implement a character-level RNN. That is, it will learn from some text one character at a time, then generate new text one character at a time.
