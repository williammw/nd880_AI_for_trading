## Perturbations on Rows
Another way to generate different trees is to grow each tree on a random subset of the original dataset’s rows. Subsets can be generated with or without replacement. When it's done with replacement, it's called bagging, and when it’s done without replacement, it’s called pasting. Bagging is short for bootstrap aggregating.
