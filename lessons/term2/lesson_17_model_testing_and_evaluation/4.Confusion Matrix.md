## Type 1 and Type 2 Errors
Sometimes in the literature, you'll see False Positives and False Negatives as Type 1 and Type 2 errors. Here is the correspondence:

* Type 1 Error (Error of the first kind, or False Positive): In the medical example, this is when we misdiagnose a healthy patient as sick.
* Type 2 Error (Error of the second kind, or False Negative): In the medical example, this is when we misdiagnose a sick patient as healthy.
