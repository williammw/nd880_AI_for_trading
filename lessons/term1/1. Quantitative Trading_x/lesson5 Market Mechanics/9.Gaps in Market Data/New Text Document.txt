Note: Pre-market sessions (for the US market) are a period of time where stocks are very thinly traded. Market participants often use this to gauge the strength and direction of the market. Post-market sessions are often used by traders who want to trade on corporate announcements made after market closes, or for brokers to make whole of an incomplete client order.
