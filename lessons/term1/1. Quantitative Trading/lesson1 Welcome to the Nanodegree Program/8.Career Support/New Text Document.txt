Career Support
Career Service: No Resubmission Required
In Term 2 of this Nanodegree Program, you get personalized feedback on your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. Increase your online presence and attract the attention of recruiters and collaborators, or just meet people with similar interests and grow your network.Unlike other Nanodegree projects, you submit to a Career Service once to get feedback and do not need to meet specifications to continue on in your program.

The value of Career Service reviews is not in meeting specifications on subjective rubric items, but in getting honest, personalized guidance from a Career Mentor. Learning from this guidance is what will guide you on the path to truly improving your job search materials.

We highly encourage you to take advantage of this guidance. Most Alumni who report jobs and other opportunities (such as collaboration) attribute their success to networking.
